            <h3>Personal Background:</h3>
            <p>I have lived in Gastonia, North Carolina throughout my whole life. <br>
               I also come from a stem-based family, with software engineers, mechanical engineers, and chemists.
            </p>
    
             <h3>Professional Background:</h3>
             <p>As of right now, I have not had the oppurtunity to work in the computer science field. That said, 
                I have been a TA for an Introductory Brain and Behavior class at UNCC. 
            </p>
    
            <h3>Academic Background:</h3>
            <p>In May of 2023, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Pyschology from UNCC. During that time, I was planning on working in Neuroscience. As of right now, I
                am working on getting my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. My expected graduation is May 2025.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Background in Web-Development:</h3>
            <p>Over the summer, I primarily focused on taking a full-stack Udemy course. During this course, I worked in-depth with HTML, CSS, and
                various frameworks like Bootstrap. I also created a few small-scale projects, as well as my own portfolio.
            </p>

            <h3>Primary Computer Platform:</h3>
            <p>On campus (MAC) | At home (Windows)</p>

            <h3>Courses I'm Taking:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering | required, but excited to take</li>
                <li>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design | required, but excited to take</li>
                <li>ITCS 4102 - Programming Languages | not required </li>
                <li>ITCS 3112 - Design and Implementation of Object Oriented Systems | required, and excited to take</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Funny Fact about Me:</h3>
            <p>I believe I should be sponsored by "Monster Energy", due to the sheer amount of money I have spent on them.
                For example, I typically get the 24 pack from Sam's Club every two weeks. </p>

            <h3>I'd also like to share:</h3>
            <p>I am a huge animal lover, which has led me to have weird pets over my lifetime. 
                As a teenager, I had two pet rats, guinea pigs, mice, dogs, cats, hamsters, and so on. 
             As of now, I just have 3 cats.
            </p>
